Soloban creates a management dashboard that integrates your tools and data for daily use with just a few clicks.

## Soloban is a information management software with a visual focus
The number of tools (including SaaS) surrounding individuals and companies is increasing at an accelerating pace, enabling us to simplify and automate individual tasks.

At the same time, however, we still spend a lot of time structuring and organizing documents, spend extra working hours looking at the information we need, and have trouble collaborating because the information we are looking at is different.

As the number of tools increases, information management issues such as important information getting lost or scattered and only a limited number of departments having access to the tools become more apparent.

Soloban will help you to integrate and visualize data scattered across local systems and tools to reduce the amount of time wasted on information access and communication.
